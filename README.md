# Murakami
Murakami is a customized minimalistic [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) theme inspired by
[KISS](https://github.com/calincru/KISS).

Check it out on [my blog](http://quangteomedia.com).

## Features
- Minimalistic & responsive
- Google Analytics
- Disqus comments
- 46 Social icons ([Fontello](http://fontello.com))
- Minified assets
- Code syntax highlighting (via [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/))
- Script for easy updating

## SEO
- Post tags as meta keywords

## Configuration
Make sure you modify all my personal stuff, such as:
- Social links (`social.hbs`)
- Google Analytics tracking code (`analytics.hbs`) ([sign
  up](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=analytics&userexp=signup&hl=en)
  and they will provide the whole new JS code)
- Disqus shortname (`disqus.hbs`)
- Blog cover: if you don't set your own cover, it'll show mine :)

## Check for update

If you have already installed the theme, you can update it executing

```bash
sh update.sh
```
